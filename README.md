# Image-Classification-Using-CNN
This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify food images into 20 distinct categories. Leveraging the MobileNetV2 architecture and a curated dataset of over 16,000 images sourced from Kaggle, the model achieves efficient classification with an accuracy of 87%.
